Worked on solving the 8-Queens problem using a stack for Data Structures at BU 2012

Output should be:
8, 4

7, 2

6, 7

5, 3

4, 6

3, 8

2, 5

1, 1


Challenges:
What to do during a conflict with a piece that has already reached column 8
Resolution:
Pop head, adjust new head to (row, column+1)
If new head is already at the 8th column, pop that as well
